**The Amazing Zach**

Guy from Wisconsin turned Phoenix, AZ resident with a passion for life's adventures!

**By Day:** He trades his guitar for a calculator, serving as the practice manager for an oculoplastic medical practice. Don't worry, he's still got that MBA magic from Morehead State University in Kentucky.

**By Night (and Weekends):** This Air Force veteran turns computer whiz into a rockstar guitarist, painting miniatures (because who doesn't love tiny soldiers?), and traveling to places with awesome running and biking trails. When the sun sets over the desert, he's all about that #oculoplasticslife!

**Home Sweet Home:** You can find me soaking up the Phoenix sunshine, exploring new trails, or strumming a tune on my guitar in this beautiful Arizona city!

Thanks LLaMA 3.1 for the introduction.
